## Introduction
This is the novel and sophisticated PETL framework for the RS image-text retrieval task, the PyTorch source code of the paper "Parameter-Efficient Transfer Learning for Remote Sensing Image-Text Retrieval". Specifically, the proposed framework consists of the pretrained CLIP model, the multimodal remote sensing adapter (MRS-Adapter), and a hybrid multi-modal contrastive (HMMC) learning objective.

1. We design a simple yet effective loss function: the hybrid multi-modal contrastive (HMMC) loss for PETL-based RS image-text retrieval. Experimental results prove that the proposed HMMC loss is effective in further improving the performance on top of the proposed MRS-Adapter.
2. We provide comprehensive empirical studies for the PETL-based RS image-text retrieval task. Our qualitative and quantitative results demonstrate that the proposed method is promising and of great potential for practical applications.
3. Extensive experiments show that our approach can significantly reduce 98.9\% of fine-tuning parameters without performance sacrifice compared to full fine-tuning. Our retrieval performance exceeds traditional methods by 7-13\%. The comprehensive benchmark results are insightful for future research.
